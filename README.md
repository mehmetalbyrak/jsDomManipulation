# Dynamic DOM Manipulation

This project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and interactive web page. The core functionality involves manipulating the DOM to update element styles (background and text colors) dynamically each time the page is refreshed.

## Overview

The page contains a structured layout with a container and multiple `div` elements. Using JavaScript, the project applies randomly generated colors to the container and its child elements, showcasing the power of DOM manipulation. This project is simple, responsive, and cross-browser compatible.

## Project Files Overview

- **index.html**: Defines the HTML structure of the page.
- **style.css**: Handles the styling and responsive layout of the elements.
- **script.js**: Implements the DOM manipulation logic to generate random colors.


## How It Works

1. The page is structured into a container with multiple child `div` elements.
2. On each page refresh, JavaScript dynamically:
   - Changes the containerâ€™s background color.
   - Updates the background and text colors of each child `div`.
3. Colors are randomly generated using a custom JavaScript function.
